        <h1>Ownership</h1>
        <br>
          <p>As of early 2018 Graingy has been owned fully by the Soian Empire. Despite this, our operations remain by and large independent.</p>
          <br>
          <p>For the almost ninety years prior to 2018 Graingy was owned in full by our CEOs, with an ambiguous legal nature. 
            The Canadian government granted special status in echange for technological and economic benefits, 
            especially in supporting the infrastructure and economy of the northern territories.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Graingy does not trade stocks or have any public ownership elements. 
            On top of that, Graingy is not considered, de jure, a corporation, as it is not legally a person nor operates as such. 
            De facto many agreements and arrangements have historically been made as though it were, 
            albeit under the technical understanding that the honouring of such actions were done to a great extent through Graingy's good will.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>This information is considered sufficiently important to our operations and international relationships as to have its own page highlighting it.</h2>
