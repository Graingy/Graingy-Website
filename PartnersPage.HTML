        <h1>Partners</h1>
        <br>
          <p>Graingy's independence leads to few interorganizational projects, so the few extant and former partnerships are worth mentioning.</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Current</h1>
          <br>
          <div class="OverviewBox">

            <br>
            <h2>Eel Protectorate</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This environmental protection organization patrols the Garrison Isles in the Tumour to protect endemic Garrison Eel populations, which are of scientific interest to Graingy. 
                The ecosystem around the Garrison Isles has been greatly damaged by polution, 
                however the Garrison Eel miraculously adapted by siphoning electrical energy from batteries which had been discarded into the sea.</p>
              <br>
            <p>The Garrison Eel has recently been threatened by the MWBS, a raiding organization originally believed to be salvaging these batteries for economic gains, 
                though this explanation has been thrown into doubt as of lately. 
                Nevertheless, the Eel Protectorate directly opposes this threat to the Garrison Eel via military force.

            <h2>Cshrankorp</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A front organization for the state of Cshrankila created under warming relations with Soia shortly after the Fourth Great War of Anstrake. 
              While briefly in a trade agreement with Graingy, 
              Cshrankila's granting of the MWBS (the rival of Graingy partner Eel Protectorate) a small aircraft carrier has caused a falling out between Graingy and Cshrankorp.
              As of present relations do not look likely to improve anytime soon.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The carrier, named <i>MBS Sunfish</i> under MWBS service, has fortunately not reached operational status yet, 
              though the act of gifting it is considered hostile nonetheless.</p>
