        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <br>
          <p>For the uninitiated, Graingy is (technically speaking) an independent research organization devoted to the development of technology, 
            historically acquiring its funding through entrepreneurial means, selling technology and manufacturing services.</p>
            <br>
          <p>We were founded in the middle of 1928 by engineer Daren Sesame, soon moving to the Yukon territory of Canada in search of open space and independence to experiment.
            For almost ninety years we were headquarted in Northern Canada (making a move to what would eventually become Nunavut in 1955). 
            During this time  reached the forefront of technology in numerous fields, a position we continue to hold.
          </p>
          <br>
        <h1>History Overview</h1>
        <br>
          <p>After our 1928 founding and subsequent moving to the Yukon, Graingy first set to developing a technological portfolio, centring on the airplane.
            By the mid 1930s, however, events over in Germany had forced a hard turn towards military development. 
            Through clever business and cutting edge techniques Graingy had managed to become one of the best-equipped aeronautical producers in the west by its tenth birthday.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Throughout the Second World War any resources that weren't devoted to mass production of low cost equipment were thrown into R&D. 
            Courtesy of being the biggest industrial body north of the 60th parallel (Leningrad as a close contender), significant freedom was permitted (begrudgingly) from the Canadian government.
            By 1945 Graingy had claimed speed records in displacement hull vessel (60 knots, GADS Sesame, heavy cruiser) and 
            piston engine aircraft (>950km/h, GPP-910, prototype anti-jet interceptor), among others, had developed its own early jet aircraft, and, perhaps most shockingly,
            became the second operator of a nuclear reactor after the Manhattan project (a discovery that did <strong>NOT</strong> please the Canadian government).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The Cold War was a period of new resources, pushing our sciences into the realms of microchips and early intelligent systems, 
            afterburners and supersonic jets, rockets and spacecraft. With a new headquarters further east, the only side we took was science.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>In the modern day, after our Soian acquisition, our work has only become more ambitious. 
            Nothing demonstrates this clearler than the intensification of the M.U.M.A.P program, the largest heavier-than-air aircraft to ever take to the skies.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h1>Operations and Plants</h1>
          <br>
          <p>We have major plants operating in:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Island of Soia (1 - HQ)</li>
              <li>The Dominion of Canada (3)</li>
              <li>The Ialian Republic (1)</li>
              <li>Japan (1)</li>
              <li>Antarctica (1)</li>
            </ul>
          <p>This does not include the vast multitude of smaller facilities in our supply chain, or dormant/closed plants, such as the recently closed Detroit plant.</p>
